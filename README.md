This is the VHS-Lot source code repository. 
Built with the MERN stack, some tools used are:

Express: used for the back-end 
Mongoose: used to simplify working with MongoDB
Body-parser: parse incoming request bodies
Concurrently: lets us run back and front end components separately
Winston: logger for server side requests
Chalk: log organizer
